## Some Background

(not really nec at all)

Physicists today have a "Standard Model" that describes how various forces we encounter in nature

- Gravity
- Electricity
- Magnetism
- Weak Nuclear Force
- Strong Nuclear Force

can be understood in terms of more fundamental interactions.

Particles and their interactions.

are really just different
aspects
of fewer, more fundamental interactions.

the first three of which are quite familiar in everyday life.

On 4 July 2012, Researchers at European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) reported 
that they had recorded events in the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC that had properties
consistent with a new particle in this menagerie, the Higgs Boson.
